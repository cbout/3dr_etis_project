Steps to add a new action in our interface for the drone solo 3DR :

0) First of all we have actually two types of orders : 
	- order for displaying informations of the vehicle
	- order to be sent directly to the drone

1) Thus the first step is to write on the file "mavlink_msg_order.c", in the corresponding function, a new case with a new char/int where the action function is call. 
	- for a display you can call a already-made or yourself-made function from the
	  file "mavlink_display.c" with vehicle variable in parameter
	- for a order to the drone you may call a mavlink_msg pack function to encode the
	  right informations in the msg pointer, to find more informations about 
	  mavlink_msg we advice to refer you to the "mavlink-devguide.pdf"

2) The next step is to add the new command in the corresponding menu in the file "mavlink_display.c" with the char/int selected previously and a short description of the action.

3) To finish if an answer is expected, on the file "mavlink_msg_decode.c" in the function mavlink_msg_decode_answer, add a case with the type of the answer expected, create a variable of this type, initialize it with the right decode function and do the processing that you want.
